  Good Morning. As you are already aware we are Recruit and Retain, a company built to solve all of the complex business problems circled around People Analytics. Every company collects at least some data on their workforce in an effort to track and improve their recruiting and retainment practices, and we are here to empower you with the tools you need to properly analyze that data which in turn will save you money and make your employees happier. Some of the services we provide are listed here on our main landing page. We help you with Staffing and Recruitment, provide on-going Cost Analysis, Minimize Turnover, Analyze Workforce Demographics, Workforce Forecasting, and Employee Engagement. We will explain these services further as we move throughout the presentation.First, I’ll highlight our team as it stands today. 

I’m Sandra Hall, the Project Manager. In other words, I’m nobody without all these rock-stars you see here. 

Next, we have Alejandra Herbas, one of our two Machine Learning Specialists. She flexes her muscles building Regression Models and Neural Networks out of your data to make predictions into the future of your business, overall saving you time and money. 

The third person on the top row is Fraol Abebe who specializes in Data Engineering and Data Visualization. Soon you’ll see many of the visualizations she put together which provide useful insight into your data and answer questions you didn’t even know you had. 

The fourth person on our team is Marilou Francis, another Data Engineering Expert and Web-Scraping Specialist. She spends her time taking your data, transforming it into something we can use for practically anything your heart desires, and has the ability to gather data from anywhere that is legal. You’ll also see that she is an Expert in Data Visualization. In other words, she’s a jack of all trades and master of all! 

The fifth person listed is Sam Smith, another Machine Learning Specialist. He works closely with Alejandra building models, comparing their Accuracy Scores, R-squared values, and coding in Python. Someone with his chops needs glasses to look the part, but since he recently had a successful Lasik procedure—he won’t be needing those anymore! 

Next we have Anthony Hughes, our latest addition bringing years of experience in the field—working with clients all the way from the federal level down to small, private sector companies. His efforts are most visible in the User Experience of the Dashboards we assemble, and in the magical wording we use to translate all the technological jargon we throw around into everyday English. 

And finally we have our User Experience Specialist and Lead—Renier Mendez. One of the most  committed and passionate people I have ever met—he uses his high energy levels to assemble all you will see today, creating a flawless platform to present the Analysis we put together based upon your company’s data.

 Moving onto our Company Portfolio, we will go over some things we have offered in the past before getting into your company’s analysis. When looking at this, keep in 
mind that these are services we could offer you as well if we collect more data in further research. Fraol will go over the next section.

Now we are moving onto your company’s particular analysis. Since turnover is easily costing you millions of dollars per year, our first step was to uncover the drivers of attrition. We identified salary is a strong driver of turnover, lower salary employees leaving at much higher rates than those in high or median incomes. The graph on the bottom analyzes employees making 50,000 dollars per year or less. Tonarrow this down to the most problematic departments, we found that Attrition is highest in Research and Development and Sales. We looked at this further in the Donut charts above, which showcases the salary disparity in the total population. Retained employees are easily making about 30,000 dollars per year or more consistently across each department, than the employees who have left the company. Fraol will explain the bar charts on the left. 
The idea and Opening - Alejandra:Our project is called “Recruit and Retain”. We chose this specific title because our project measures human resources metrics from a given set and uses those to propose business solutions such as cost savings for a company and employee retention. Our audience would be a CFO or other company leader who is able to make decisions on behalf of the business regarding budgets and hiring. We will be delivering the first portion of the presentation from the perspective of an HR Analystdelivering metrics and recommendations to a board of company executives.Product Overview:Good Morning, As Alejandra just said we are Recruit and Retain and we have developed an interactive product that will deliver insights into your business and improve your bottom line. During our analysis we uncovered some trends that we will bring to your attention now and visualize:-Should your company really be spending $9.7 million per year on turnover alone?-The average years employees currently with the company have spent is 7 years while the employees who left hold an average tenure of 5 years.-As a stretch objective the target should be to raise the average tenure of employees who leave the company to, at a minimum, match the current 7-year average of employees currently with the company.When developing a strategy to increase employee retention to meet this stretch objective, we recommend to immediately target the current population who falls within the 3-5 year tenure as an urgent priority—since these will be critical years in changing this metric to develop a trend in a positive direction. We are happy to offer a more targeted analysis on this population in the future.-If this problem is not resolved, in 5 years the company will have wasted $50 millionin simply not making their best efforts to retain their recruited talent.The last metrics we highlighted at the top of the dashboard is an average overtime rate of 28%, which means this percentage of all employees are working overtime consistently—we will explain more through a visual later in the presentation of why this important.During our analysis we have identified the key drivers of turnover. Being that this is one of your greatest expenses we will provide insights into these drivers which include:

2. Salary disparities – the chart clearly shows the lower the salary, the more employees leave. Which indicates a more serious problem of the likelihood you are not offering a fair market salary. With this issue, you will not attract the best talent and you certainly will not retain them. 3. We have uncovered some concerning metrics in the human resources dept as you can see, women not only are consistently leaving their jobs very quickly in this department but they are harshly outnumbered as well. The metrics for men in this department are entirely the opposite—on average they are paid much more, they stay in their positions nearly twice as long as women, however they are average a job satisfaction of 1. Women averages about a 2.5 rating in this department. I wouldstrongly encourage further investigation of the metrics we uncovered as there is a strong indication of an unhealthy work environment for women. Looking at every filter, you will see there is a consistent turnover in the lower salaryranges. Our recommendation to the company executives would be to truly evaluate your strategies in retaining these key, lower level employees since they will be the future of your company when your current leaders retire. The second driver of attrition is overtime. We have created a pie chart which draws a key metric from the population who are consistently working overtime. This pie chart was created after a statistical analysis ranking correlations between all variables in the dataset with their relationship to attrition. It was found that overtime is the key driver of turnover. As you can see 40% of those working overtime leave the company. We would like to work with you to determine what is driving the need for so much overtime. Are employees overworked because the turnover rate is so high? There is the possibility that the staffing model needs to be adjusted to match the current workload. We can investigate more overtime metrics with further analysis that could possibly reveal poor management practices localized in a certain department or simply would highlight departments who seriously need more manning.In regards to the employee satisfaction rating being in the medium-high range but having a currently overall turnover rate of 16% we would also ask the question of are your employee surveys anonymous? It might be worth it to look at the mechanism in which employee surveys are given and to ensure employees know their ratings are anonymous so they will rate it more honestly, because it’s clear based off of this data some employees might fear retaliation, but we are happy to conduct further analysis to uncover any other information that would help propose solutions for the future.In Conclusion:To conclude today, I will recap our findings:1.Turnover costs money—nearly $10 million per year to be exact. Minimizing turnover would have positive affects by itself, but one of the best being the cost savings.

  Overtime costs money too--$11.3 million for people who have already left your company and $17.1 million for those you still employ. There are actions that could be taken to minimize this cost—all of them having a positive domino affect on other factors in your business.3.Climate surveys are important—perhaps even the most important metric you measure. Keeping these accurate and anonymous are the only way to get a true measurement of how the employees currently feel. As Marc Bennioff founder of Salesforce says—“Acquiring the right talent is the most important key to growth. Hiring was and still is—the most important thing we do.”Although these issues might currently be concentrated to simply one department, it’s important to develop an action plan soon which could stop these negative trends before the problem grows to be company-wide and would have an even larger affect on the success of your business. Thank you for working with us to develop this analysis and allowing us the opportunity to improve your business processes. Data Engineering:1.When we located our data it was in the form of a csv on Kaggle.  Once we determined that dataset could be used we then had to decide what means we would use to load the data into the final JavaScript file.2.We then used AWS as a remote database which then connected to MySQL Workbench where we began to examine our data and build queries to find the most useful metrics. Also as we were examining our data we realized we would need to uncover the strongest correlations so we used the Data Analysis functions in Excel to uncover the strongest relationships.  We then ranked them in a chart that we could reference and built Pivot Tables to visualize what those relationships would look like.3.After we built a few queries we then created API endpoints in an app.py file that would deploy the application.4.Once we had queries to work with, we then designed the look of the final application through a sketch and through a PowerPoint. We also sketched thelook of the page on layoutit.com.5.After designing the basic look of the page, we created a JavaScript file to plot the data using Plotly.UX Considerations:At the top of our page we highlighted key metrics such as the cost of turnover, average years spent in the company, and the annual overtime rate. We calculated annual turnover rate by counting the number of employees who regularly work overtime and dividing by the count of the total population, to arrive at a percentage.We included an interactive bar chart which shows the relationship between annual income and number of employees. 

The drop drown allows us to filter down this datato specific genders and specific departments, uncovering the most concentrated areas or “problem areas”. This graph definitely helped us draw lots of more questions that we will be answering with even further analysis. Our next visualization is a Key Metric letting the company leader know the average employee satisfaction rating. Since we were creating a product that could be used to improve recruiting and retention we wanted to zero in on visualizations that were useful and uncovered theunderlying issues driving extra spending and employee turnover. We did a lot of research on what companies like to see in a Human Resources dashboard as well aswhich analytics would benefit companies the most. At this stage we also were able to speak with a current People Analytics Analyst through networking on LinkedIn and learned a lot about the key metrics to include in the dashboard and the best way to present them in our application. Group Dynamic - Sam: We worked really well together and were respectful to oneanother in the development of the dashboard.  Unfortunately, we do not have coding experience in our background so there was quite a large learning curve in creating an interactive product like this.  We were very limited on time to deliver so that was also an issue as well. I’m proud to say we helped each other through each and every step, though, and we are able to walk away with a lot more knowledge than we had coming in.Challenges- Fraol: We found questions about certain variables in our data set such as monthly rate vs hourly rate, and daily rate etc.  We had to perform some analysis just to get a full understanding of how these figures were rated and how we could use them. Takeaways:One take away was learning a lot more regarding Data Engineering.  Learning piece by piece in class is helpful but seeing how the Data Engineering fully comes to together definitely helps to understand.  We also learned that the data really needs to be fully explored in every way possible, and time is crucial when there are so many steps to go through to create an interactive product.Differently or with more time?We could have been more organized in the steps we needed to take rather than focusing on one step at a time.  There were a lot of ideas in the beginning and we spent far too much time narrowing down which visualizations we were actually going to use in the end. There was a lot of time spent narrowing our scope as well. We also found ourselves spending time trying to solve problems and errors when it came to building the proper event listeners and interaction on the application. We do realize that was probably because of lack experience.
